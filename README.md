--------------------------------------------------

wcf routing is one of the interesting functionalities of the wcf (at least my opinion).
here we have two hosts that are gonig to be choosed by routing host depending on filter

and of course - there is a failover host (here just for the host 1) that will be hit by routing host if host 1 id down.
